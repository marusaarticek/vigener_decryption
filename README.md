..decryption of vigener chipered text..

Cryptanalysis of the Vigenere cipher has 2 main steps: 

-identify the period of the cipher (the length of the key)
-find the specific key

To identify the period we use a test based on the Index of Coincidence, 
to find the specific key we use the Chi-squared statistic.
